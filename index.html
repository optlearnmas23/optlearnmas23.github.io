								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							Stimulated by various emerging applications involving agents to solve complex problems in
							real-world domains, such as intelligent sensing systems for the Internet of the Things (IoT),
							automated configurators for critical infrastructure networks, and intelligent resource allocation for
							social domains (e.g., security games for the deployment of security resources or
							auctions/procurements for allocating goods and services), agents in these domains commonly
							leverage different forms optimization and/or learning to solve complex problems.
							<br>
							The goal of the workshop is to provide researchers with a venue to discuss models or techniques for
							tackling a variety of multi-agent optimization problems. We seek contributions in the general area of
							multi-agent optimization, including distributed optimization, coalition formation, optimization
							under uncertainty, winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements, and algorithms
							to compute Nash and other equilibria in games. Of particular emphasis are contributions at the
							intersection of optimization and learning.
							See below for a (non-exhaustive) list of topics.
							</p>
							<p>
							This workshop invites works from different strands of the multi-agent systems community that
							pertain to the design of algorithms, models, and techniques to deal with multi-agent optimization
							and learning problems or problems that can be effectively solved by adopting a multi-agent
							framework.
							</p>
							<h3>Topics</h3>
							The workshop organizers invite paper submissions on the following (and related) topics:
							<ul>
								<li>Optimization for learning (strategic and non-strategic) agents</li>
								<li>Learning for multi-agent optimization problems</li>
								<li>Distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization</li>
								<li>Winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements</li>
								<li>Coalition or group formation algorithms</li>
								<li>Algorithms to compute Nash and other equilibria in games</li>
								<li>Optimization under uncertainty</li>
								<li>Optimization with incomplete or dynamic input data</li>
								<li>Algorithms for real-time applications</li>
								<li>Cloud, distributed and grid computing</li>
								<li>Applications of learning and optimization in societally beneficial domains</li>
								<li>Multi-agent planning</li>
								<li>Multi-robot coordination</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The workshop is of interest both to researchers investigating applications of multi-agent systems to optimization problems in large, complex domains, as well as to those examining optimization and learning problems that arise in systems comprised of many autonomous agents. In so doing, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to discuss common issues that arise in solving optimization and learning problems in different areas, to introduce new application domains for multi-agent optimization techniques, and to elaborate common benchmarks to test solutions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of benchmarks and data sets 
								that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in 
								machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
							</p>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> The workshop will be a one-day 
							meeting.  It will include a number of  technical  
							sessions, a poster session where presenters can discuss their work, with
							the aim of  further fostering collaborations, multiple invited
							speakers covering crucial challenges for the field of
							multiagent optimization and learning.</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

									<h3>Challenges in design space exploration and design optimization of aerospace systems</h3>
								</header>
								Erich Wehrle, Collins Aerospace
								<br>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong>
								<br>	
								New requirements for sustainable, efficient and economic aviation present the sector with new design possibilities and constraints. 
								The aviation industry has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
								This ambitious goal necessitates a new thinking in aircraft design to accelerate development with special attention to these goals in the development at aircraft as well as system and component levels.
								<br>
								Algorithmic-supported design methods in concert with accurate parametric models are powerful tools in the conception and development of aerospace systems and components. 
								As such, applications range from optimal design of aircraft system architecture and high-performance structures of fiber-reinforced polymer to optimal parameters for manufacturing systems to optimal flight path design.
								<br>
								This talk will discuss reason-based system architecture exploration and design optimization of complex aircraft systems. 
								As central role of multidisciplinary design optimization, this includes the use of physics-based parametric modeling and advanced multi-fidelity surrogating. 
								The challenges to application of optimization and reason-based design exploration will be outlined and needs for future research in this area motivated.
								<br>
								<strong>Bio:</strong>
								<br>	
								Dr.-Ing. Erich Wehrle leads the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization research group at Collins Aerospace. 
								The team’s research focuses on algorithmic support in the design of complex aircraft systems, especially via system architecture exploration and design optimization considering multiple disciplines and physics-based simulation models.
								<br>
								He previously held roles in academia as Assistant Professor at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy) and as postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University Munich (Germany) in which his research addressed design optimization of lightweight structures and mechanical systems under a multidisciplinary perspective, including structural analysis, multibody dynamics, crash mechanics and uncertainty. 
								He holds a doctorate and a master in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich and a bachelor in Mechanical Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo (USA).

							All papers must be submitted in PDF format, using the <a href="https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/443/2022/06/AAMAS-2023-Formatting-Instructions.zip">AAMAS-23 author kit</a>. 
							Submissions should include the name(s), affiliations, and email addresses of all authors. 
							<br>
							Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, significance, and 
							clarity. Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least two program committee members.
							<br>
							Submissions of papers rejected from the IJCAI 2023 technical program are welcomed. 
							<!-- Papers will be selected for oral and/or poster presentation at the workshop.  -->
							</p>


							<h4>Fast Track (Rejected IJCAI papers)</h4>
							<p>
							Rejected IJCAI papers with *average* scores of at least weak reject/weak accept may be submitted  
							to OptLearnMAS along with previous reviews and scores and an optional letter indicating how the 
							authors have addressed the reviewers comments.
							<br>
							Please use the submission link above and indicate that the submission is a resubmission from 
							of a IJCAI rejected paper. Also OptLearnMAS submission, reviews and optional letter 
							need to be compiled into a single pdf file.
							<br>
							These submissions will not undergo the regular review process, but a light one, performed by the 
							chairs, and will be accepted if the previous reviews are 
							judged to meet the workshop standard. 
							</p>

							<h4> Best Papers</h4>
							<p>
							Per the AAMAS Workshop organizers:<br>

							There will be a Springer issue for best workshop papers and visionary papers, so each workshop should nominate two papers, one for each special issue. The authors should be aware that if the nominated workshop paper is also an AAMAS paper (or some other conference paper), the version in the Springer books should have additional material (at least 30% more).
